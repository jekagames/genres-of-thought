			<div id="spiel1">In this game, players act out scenes where they behave according to an assigned movie genre, and between these scenes, have discussions based on a prompt. Your group should play about 3-5 rounds of this game in a session, but feel free to play more rounds if you're having a good time. <br><br></div>
			<div id="spiel2"><b>GAMEMASTER INSTRUCTIONS</b><br>
As the gamemaster, your responsibilities are to communicate information to players secretly, narrate the world that they are acting upon (describing objects, locations, and events), decide when to cut each round, and facilitate the discussion period between each round. After the discussion each round, use the button below to re-roll the information for the next round<br><br>

<b>RULES FOR PLAYERS</b><br>
Players are responsible for acting out scenes together based on the information they are provided by the gamemaster and while trying to fulfill their objectives. In between rounds, the players and gamemaster engage in a discussion inspired by a prompt. <br><br>

Players should act the way that they would if they were in a movie of the genre provided, with awareness of the horizon of expectations of these films. Feel free to play supporting roles in the scene.<br><br>

The <b>"Yes, and..."</b> Rule: You should accept and integrate other players' ideas on stage. If they say that a certain event has occurred, or that you are in a certain location, you should build on that idea. <br><br>

<b>EACH ROUND</b><br>
The gamemaster will roll the information for the round by pressing the button below. Decide as a group which player will be assigned the odd genre out -- you may decide based on discussion or via chance. The gamemaster will secretly provide (either via text message, on a piece of paper, or by whispering) players with the movie genre they are in, and, in the case of the player with the odd genre out, their personal movie genre and their secret objective. Save the prompt for the discussion between rounds. <br><br>

The players will set up their own scene, and the gamemaster will occasionally help describe occurrences in the scene that are independent of the characters. The gamemaster will cut the scene when they feel it is appropriate to do so. <br><br>

Between each round, the gamemaster and players engage in a sincere discussion about a prompt. There is no rule for how long this discussion should be, but there should be a general consensus that it's time to move on. After the last round, you may choose to have a larger discussion about systems of thought and the horizons of expectations that they build. To a person with a hammer, does everything indeed look like a nail?<br>
